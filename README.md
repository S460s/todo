\*\*TODO project from TOP.

This is the second time I am doing the project. The first time the code got pretty messy and I decided to do it again.

---

\*Things to improve:

1. The deleting project system.
2. The editing system.

   const stopEdit = function (card) {
   card.addEventListener("mouseleave", () => {
   addProjectBtn.style.display = "block";
   start();
   });
   };
